        We analyzed <strong>Obama's Flint water crisis speech</strong>. 

        <br><br>In 2016, rumors of unsanitary, discolored water in Flint, Michigan peaked: this led Michigan Governor Rick Snyder to declare a state of public emergency. 

The issue became so severe that President Obama traveled to Flint on May 4th to speak to Flint’s residents. 

<br><br>In his speech on the Flint Water Crisis, President Obama highlights the current progress made and the future actions needed to resolve the crisis.

This relates to the global issue: How does a developed country ensure that its citizens have access to clean water and sanitation? (United Nations SDG #6) <br><br>

        <p><strong><u>Political Influence on War</u></strong></p>
        <span><strong>&#x2192; pathos &#x2190;</strong></span> <br><br>
        <span class="quote">“The sacrifices of war are immeasurable. Too many have returned from Iraq with that soldier’s 
            story ­­with broken bodies and shattered nerves and wounds that even the best care may not
            heal. Too many of our best have come home shrouded in the flag they loved. Too many moms 
            and dads and husbands and wives have answered that knock on the door that’s hardest for 
            any loved one to hear. And the rest of us have seen too many promises of swift victories and 
            dying insurgencies and budding democracy giving way to the reality of a brutal civil war that 
            goes on and on and on to this day.”
            </span>
        <p>Pathos is prominent inside Obama’s speech. Obama says that </p>
            <p class="quote">“Too many have returned from Iraq with that soldier’s story ­­with broken bodies and shattered nerves and wounds that even the best care may not heal.”</p>
        </p>
        <p>As a general listener to the speech, and with no experience in any warfare or the army, I still considerably connect with Obama’s pathos usage. The soldiers who have fought in Iraq would definitely attach themselves towards Obama’s speech, and the family relatives and friends of those soldiers would be anguished and moved by these words similarly. Obama uses Pathos to sympathize with the audience, and American society, which have most likely tuned into the news for some time in the past 4 years, and saw headlines of dead American soldiers in Iraq. To be reminded of the fears that are happening outside of America, but to the people inside America, with vivid adjectives such as “shattered nerves” and “broken bodies” would be heartbreaking for most, and would spur a rage against the continuation of the war. </p>
        <p>
            Obama does not stop with the pains of the soldiers. Instead, he extrapolates to the moms and dads, and husbands of the soldiers: “Too many moms and dads and husbands and wives have answered that knock on the door that’s hardest for any loved one to hear.” The knock on the door means that their husband, or their son, has died in the Iraq War, and would never return home. 
            </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, Obama pursues this emotional strain by further expanding his audience to the all of society:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">“And the rest of us have seen too many promises of swift victories and dying insurgencies and budding democracy giving way to the reality of a brutal civil war that goes on and on and on to this day.”</p>
        <p>Obama explains that the news and speeches american society hears teem with superficial claims of <i class="quote">“swift victories”</i> and <i class="quote">“dying insurgencies”</i> without really divulging the harsh realities, deaths, and pain that comes with a war of attrition, the type of war that <i class="quote">“goes on and on and on to this day”</i>. Obama makes sure to remind us of the length of the war, which to the day of the speech, has been 4 years. 
        </p>
        <p>All in all, Obama expertly uses Pathos to sympathize with an emotionally stressed audience during the fourth year of the Iraq war. </p>

            <h2 class="paragraph-title">Many works are concerned with human suffering. How has this concern been expressed in a way that engages audiences of various times and/or places in two of the works you have studied?
            </h2>
            <p>Barack Obama’s collection of speeches and Shakespeare’s Othello both express human suffering in a way that engages audiences of various times and/or places. However, the two works are considerably different in their expression of human suffering in terms of the employment of literary and stylistic devices and the intended purpose / calibration to each audience’s needs. Whereas Shakespeare’s Othello encourages human suffering to generate a commercially attractive play for the Elizabethan audience, Obama placates human suffering to manifest his support for a modern third world audience. 
            </p>
            <p>Obama speeches and Othello calibrate human suffering towards their specific audience which generates different intended messages. Obama’s speeches focus on manifesting Obama’s emotional, and tangible support towards the respective audience. In the Flint Water Crisis Speech Obama gave in 2016, the president dealt with an anguished crowd. The Flint residency had experienced unsanitary drinking water for the past 18 months. To show that Obama cared for the Flint people, he rhetorically and effectively posed questions that the audience was nostalgically familiar with. Obama asks the simple question of if he can get a cup of water. The population of Flint had been protesting with the words “give me some [clean] water” and “I want a [safe] glass of water”.  The question is meant to connect directly with Flint’s citizens by repeating the same question that they have been asking since the start of the crisis. This shows that Obama knows what it feels like to be in the audience’s current situation. Whereas Obama answers the question and does actually get a glass of water, the question is asked for the rhetorical effect. Imagine a wife waiting for a husband coming back from war. The wife is in emotional and physical anguish, and asks herself the question of “when will I have him back?”. Obama uses the same method, but instead, the citizens of Flint are asking “when will I have clean water”, and by actually showing a clean cup of Flint water, Obama is directly showing the audience that he knows their concerns, and knows how and why they are suffering. Obama successfully calibrates his expression of human suffering to placate an anguished audience, meanwhile propounding his intended message. 
            </p>
            <p>Conversely, since Elizabethan audiences enjoy tragedy, it is imperative that Shakespeare effectively calibrates human suffering to his commercial audience, as the intended purpose of Othello is to entertain Elizabethan audiences. Shakespeare emotionally attaches the audience to the marriage of Othello and Desdemona through two successive parts. In part 1, Shakespeare uses racism against the moor to evoke bias from the audience towards Desdemona and Othello. The audience experiences how Desdemona and Othello became lovers, when Desdemona overheard the hardships Othello overcame in war. Subsequently, Othello faces more hardships as Desdemona’s father, Brabantio, despises him due to the color of his skin. Brabantio compares Othello to a “ram” tupping his daughter. After an adamant discussion between him, Desdemona, and Othello, Brabantio agrees to their marriage, with the proviso that he would never see his daughter again. Despite Desdemona’s father’s prejudiced actions which caused emotional suffering (a father leaving his daughter), Othello and Desdemona’s love grows stronger. The overcoming of human suffering spurs the audience to root for the protagonists. However, in part 2, the relationship that the audience is rooting for starts to crumble because of the villain, Iago’s actions. The use of human suffering to create a heartbreaking death → which is a key feature of a successful tragedy, begins to foster through Iago’s manipulation on Othello. Othello, who has overcome racial prejudices elopes with Desdemona, subsequently murders her at the end of the tragedy, then killing himself. The perfect couple which has been reinvigorated through the overcoming of human suffering caused by racial differences, has just collapsed. The audience is engaged as the bond they rooted for is now dead, and may even shed a tear, fulfilling Shakespeare’s intended purpose. 
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Obama’s speeches and Shakespeare’s Othello employ different literary and stylistic devices to express human suffering in a way that engages audiences of various times and/or places. Obama heavily relies on the usage of pathos to convey his intended message. In the Flint water crisis speech, he told the audience of an anecdote of “Little Miss Flint”, a little girl who had contacted the president to discuss the water crisis. The story is woven with emotional prowess that amplifies Obama’s intended message: to show the crowd that they are being heard and felt. Obama states that “when something like this happens, a young girl shouldn't have to go to Washington to be heard.” Obama implies the severity of the water crisis by accentuating that a little girl should not have to go directly to the president to be heard. As kids are often taken more pity on, and the story of Little Miss Flint renders the sentimental audience verklempt, Obama adroitly chose to express the human suffering of a little child who wanted her voice to be heard to highlight his intended message. Furthermore, Little Miss Flint is a synecdoche that represents the holistic voice of Flint. By acknowledging Mari’s unsanitary water suffering, and by simply being the president and being physically in Flint, Obama imparts to the Flint audience that he hears them and feels them. 
            </p>
            <p>Pathos is also used in another one of Obama’s speeches. When Obama was still in the senate, he gave a senate floor speech on stopping the iraq war, which during the speech, the war was in its fourth year. Obama used pathos to calibrate human suffering towards an audience whom some were on the verge of saudade. At the start of the speech, Obama gives vivid accounts of the brutal war. Obama specifically says emotionally-charged phrases to the general groups of American society. To the soldiers, he talks about the “broken bodies and shattered nerves and wounds that even the best care may not heal”. To the wives of the soldiers, Obama explains the all too known anecdote of the knocking on the door and the tiding that the husband would never come back. To the rest of society, Obama talks about how the American people have been promised swift victory's leading to budding democracy, when in reality, the war of attrition has become a bloody eternity for americans. These focused phrases elicit sad and mournful responses; it strengthens the audience outlook that they, as a collective, have been let down. This, in turn, leads to a sense of solidarity among the people and spurs them to spite the continuation of the Iraq War, thus falling into the intended purpose of Obama’s speech, to deracinate Iraq-war-supporters. 
            </p>
            <p>The intended message of Shakespear’s Othello is mostly conveyed through the usage of dramatic irony. This is effective because it exudes more foreboding that creates a dreary visualization of all the tragic endings the audience may visualize. Whereas the intended message in Obama’s speeches concern Obama showing the audience that he feels their suffering, the intended purpose of Othello is to make the Elizabethan audience feel and care about the characters’ suffering. Dramatic irony occurs when the audience knows something that the characters don't. The audience knows that Iago, the villain of Othello, is a duplicitous character with a contrast between appearance vs reality. Iago is manipulating characters to ultimately undermine Othello’s general position, on the grounds that he suspects that Othello slept with his wife. Whenever Othello calls Iago “just” and “honest”, or when he blames Cassio and Desdemona for trivial matters, it is Iago pulling the strings in the background. The audience feels emotional stress over the character of Othello. They wonder what is about to happen to the moor. Will he internalize his moor-like beast? What will happen to the relationship between Desdemona and Othello that the audience is rooting for, as explained before? Since Elizabethan audiences were acquainted with what genre the play is set in, they know that a series of tragic events must transpire. Thus, Shakespeare leaves the audience on the edge of their seat, knowing that something bad will happen, but not knowing when or what until the end of the play. This fulfills the intended purpose of generating commercial success because audiences enjoy the feeling of suspense. 
            </p>
            <p>Overall, Barack Obama’s collection of speeches and Shakespeare’s Othello both express human suffering in a way that engages audiences of various times and/or places. However, the two works are considerably different in their expression of human suffering in terms of the employment of literary and stylistic devices and the calibration to each audience’s needs. Whereas Shakespeare’s Othello seeks to spur the audience’s emotional attachment with the protagonists, Obama needs to show the audience that he hears and feels their concerns and pleas.
