        We analyzed <strong>Obama's Flint water crisis speech</strong>. 

        <br><br>In 2016, rumors of unsanitary, discolored water in Flint, Michigan peaked: this led Michigan Governor Rick Snyder to declare a state of public emergency. 

The issue became so severe that President Obama traveled to Flint on May 4th to speak to Flint’s residents. 

<br><br>In his speech on the Flint Water Crisis, President Obama highlights the current progress made and the future actions needed to resolve the crisis.

This relates to the global issue: How does a developed country ensure that its citizens have access to clean water and sanitation? (United Nations SDG #6) <br><br>

        <p><strong><u>Political Influence on War</u></strong></p>
        <span><strong>&#x2192; pathos &#x2190;</strong></span> <br><br>
        <span class="quote">“The sacrifices of war are immeasurable. Too many have returned from Iraq with that soldier’s 
            story ­­with broken bodies and shattered nerves and wounds that even the best care may not
            heal. Too many of our best have come home shrouded in the flag they loved. Too many moms 
            and dads and husbands and wives have answered that knock on the door that’s hardest for 
            any loved one to hear. And the rest of us have seen too many promises of swift victories and 
            dying insurgencies and budding democracy giving way to the reality of a brutal civil war that 
            goes on and on and on to this day.”
            </span>
        <p>Pathos is prominent inside Obama’s speech. Obama says that </p>
            <p class="quote">“Too many have returned from Iraq with that soldier’s story ­­with broken bodies and shattered nerves and wounds that even the best care may not heal.”</p>
        </p>
        <p>As a general listener to the speech, and with no experience in any warfare or the army, I still considerably connect with Obama’s pathos usage. The soldiers who have fought in Iraq would definitely attach themselves towards Obama’s speech, and the family relatives and friends of those soldiers would be anguished and moved by these words similarly. Obama uses Pathos to sympathize with the audience, and American society, which have most likely tuned into the news for some time in the past 4 years, and saw headlines of dead American soldiers in Iraq. To be reminded of the fears that are happening outside of America, but to the people inside America, with vivid adjectives such as “shattered nerves” and “broken bodies” would be heartbreaking for most, and would spur a rage against the continuation of the war. </p>
        <p>
            Obama does not stop with the pains of the soldiers. Instead, he extrapolates to the moms and dads, and husbands of the soldiers: “Too many moms and dads and husbands and wives have answered that knock on the door that’s hardest for any loved one to hear.” The knock on the door means that their husband, or their son, has died in the Iraq War, and would never return home. 
            </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, Obama pursues this emotional strain by further expanding his audience to the all of society:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">“And the rest of us have seen too many promises of swift victories and dying insurgencies and budding democracy giving way to the reality of a brutal civil war that goes on and on and on to this day.”</p>
        <p>Obama explains that the news and speeches american society hears teem with superficial claims of <i class="quote">“swift victories”</i> and <i class="quote">“dying insurgencies”</i> without really divulging the harsh realities, deaths, and pain that comes with a war of attrition, the type of war that <i class="quote">“goes on and on and on to this day”</i>. Obama makes sure to remind us of the length of the war, which to the day of the speech, has been 4 years. 
        </p>
        <p>All in all, Obama expertly uses Pathos to sympathize with an emotionally stressed audience during the fourth year of the Iraq war. </p>
