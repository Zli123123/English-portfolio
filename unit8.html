        </h2>
        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>Anna Ahkmatova’s fifth elegy tells how she became “some other woman” with the same name, focusing on how her self perception shifted throughout time. </p>
        <p>Throughout her twenties, Anna Ahkmatova became obsessed with immortalizing herself as a famous poet, like that of Dante and his poem, Inferno. She describes this obsession of hers as a tantalizing yet futile reach to achieving fame and honor. However, she was unable to achieve this goal due to political implications under the strict Stalinist regime. The once aspiration became a source of regret, which she describes in this poem.
        </p>
        <p>In the poem, Anna Akhmatova utilizes the passing of time to express her changing self perception by reminiscing through her experiences. The specific time diction helps hint to the reader the long process of change that is happening within the poem. The free verse form of the poem develops an introspective mood that alludes to the passage of time. Finally, the symbolism enhances the description of her self perception and further contrasts between her self perception at the beginning versus the end of the poem.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Point 1: Diction (My group member did this)</strong></p>
        <p>Anna Ahkmatova effectively uses diction to differentiate her self perception at the beginning of the poem from her self perception at the end of the poem to show the long process of change.
        </p>
        <p>At the beginning of the poem, she uses strong, expressive language: “I like a river, have been turned aside by this harsh age.” These express her beginning state of self perception: remorse. She feels that her life has been completely overturned by all these harsh implementations of the Stalinist regime. She is sad that she missed the opportunity to flourish as a poet during her thirties to fifties. For example, she says “O, how many fine sights I have missed”, which refers to missed scenery inspiration. In the following lines, she continues to point out many other sources of inspiration that could have generated the poem that would immortalize her the way Inferno did Dante.
        </p>
        <p>In the middle of the poem, her diction takes a more reflective tone.
        </p>
        <p>“I know the beginnings and the ends of things, <br>

            And life after the end, and something <br>
            
            It isn’t necessary to remember now.”
            </p>
        <p>The time related diction of “beginnings” and “ends” show these thoughts have come a long time later, as she must have already experienced those. Double connotation was used in these lines to show her conflicting self perception, the process of the change. The line “It isn’t necessary to remember now” can be interpreted as the bottom of the abyss, where she has given up all hope and just wishes to forget her aspirations and deny that she ever had them. 
        </p>
        <p>However, it can also be interpreted as a moment of enlightenment, signifying she has finished hanging on to her futile regrets and accepts her past. In reality, both are accurate, as she is expressing the conflict of self perception in this moment, a part of the long process of change.
        </p>
        <p>	At the end of the poem, the diction regarding passage of time hints that as time has gone by, her self perception has leaned towards accepting.
        </p>
        <p>“Of treason, and a wrinkle that only yesterday <br>

            Was absent ... <br>
            
            But if, from that life, I could step aside, <br>
            
            And see my life such as it is, today, <br>
            
            Then at last I’d know what envy means … ”
            </p>
        <p>The time-related words “yesterday” and “today” may denote their regular dictionary definitions, but beneath the surface, yesterday embodies her past self while today embodies her current self. A long time period transpired between “yesterday” and “today”, evidenced by the wrinkle, a feature of aging, which represents maturing. It shows how the decision to change her perception from regret to acceptance has gone through serious consideration. Anna culminates the poem with “Then at last I’d know what envy means”, concluding that her current situation is better than her past situation, which confirms that her self perception has finally changed from regret to acceptance.</p>
        <p><strong>Point 2: Form (Another group member did this)</strong></p>
        <p>In her poem “Northern Elegies: Fifth”, Akhmatova uses form to develop her life experiences and the passage of time. The poem's free verse structure creates an introspective, self-reflective mood that develops the passage of time, while it’s lack of line breaks furthers this effect.
        </p>
        <p>To understand this, let’s first define an Elegy. Typically, an elegy, or elegiac poem, focuses on mourning the dead. However, elegies cover broader themes such as loss and reflection. The latter is the focus of Akhmatova’s poem, “Northern Elegies: Fifth".</p>
        <p>The poem lacks a consistent meter or rhyme scheme, making it effectively a free verse poem. Whereas some elegiac poems are written in iambic pentameter, many modern-era poems contain no set meter or form, like this one. The lack of a constant meter creates an introspective tone.</p>
        <p>For example, see the passage on screen. We can see how the verses are of different lengths, being 10, 11, 4, 7, and 10 syllables respectively. Note how the enjambment builds this effect by breaking up the 2nd and 3rd verses, followed by a shorter sentence in the third verse. Note also how the rhetorical questions add authenticity by illustrating the narrator’s thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>The free-verse style of Akhmatova’s poem creates an introspective tone by realistically conveying the narrator’s thoughts. The poem’s unstructured form, with different syllable lengths and emphasis points, makes the poem feel like a slightly disorganized, fluid-flowing stream of thoughts. This is what I mean, by an introspective mood, as the narrator is self-reflecting throughout the course of the poem. The introspective mood alludes to the passage of time in a similar way as discussed by Maxwell with diction. The free-verse style and introspective mood suggests the rapid passing of time, which helps Akhmatova reminisce on her life experiences.
        </p>
        <p>Another interesting feature of the poem’s form is the overall structure. The poem does not have any breaks; rather, it flows smoothly from one idea to the next, which is aided by the free verse structure I discussed previously. The entire poem has a single break, which is seen on screen, used to transition from the main part of the poem, which focuses on Akhmatova’s laments, to the conclusion, where Akhmatova decides that the path she took was still the best path possible.</p>
        <p>	The lack of breaks before this point builds on the free-flow, introspective style that I discussed earlier, which contributes to the feeling of time passing. However, it also has the effect of building tension up to the line-break and subsequent shift in perception. The gradually-intensifying verses before the break develop tension, like a crescendo before a fermata. This tension, along with the line break, both suggest a jump forward in time at that point.
        </p>
        <p>Thus, Akhmatova uses the poem’s form, both the free verse and lack of line breaks, to develop the passage of time.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Point 3: Symbolism (I did this)</strong></p>
        <p>
            In the poem, there are many symbols that reflect the passing of time and its effects. 
            The first line of the poem is “I, like a river”. Anna Ahkmatova manifests her depressing shift in career and life vicissitudes through the symbol of a river. A river represents how time flows indefinitely, however, objects on the river are evanescent and will eventually disappear. 
            </p>
        <p>When Anna Ahkmatova wrote “I am a substitute. My life has flowed”, she refers to how her career has flowed from being a famous poet from her thirties to her life having been impaired by Soviet Russia’s harsh societal system. The river of time flows indefinitely but Anna Ahkmatova is only an object that flows on that river. The channel of life she misses - writing more poems in her thirties to fifties, she can not retrieve it back, and can only regret it. 
        </p>
        <p>As time passes and flows, so does her self perception, “into another channel”. Anna Ahkmatova uses the word “substitute” as a means to propound how her past self perception flowed or became substituted with a more retrospective yet brooding perception. Aligning with the river symbolism, Anna can not rechoose which channel of career to enter in the past. She is stuck with her current actions, and thus is sequestered in a remorseful self perception. 
        </p>
        <p>Anna further wrote “I do not recognize my shores”, which again derives from the river symbolism. Although the line could potentially refer to Anna not knowing what channel of life she will flow to in the end, she did also write “I know the beginnings and the ends of things” in the poem. Thus, it most likely expresses her not recognizing her past poetry hiatus between her thirties to fifties to be akin to what she strived for, an immortalized poet. 
        </p>
        <p>This self perception changes with time as she gradually comes to terms with herself. 
            The river symbol manifests how Anna Ahkmatova cannot rechoose her channels of life, and that time can not stop to give her another chance because it is always flowing forward.
            </p>
        <p>Whereas the river symbol reflects Anna Ahkmatova’s brooding and uncontent self perception, the mirror is a symbol of Anna entering a new phase, coming to terms with her regrets. 
        </p>
        <p>Anna wrote: <br>
            “Like entering a mirror, with a dull sense Of treason”
            </p>
        <p>Often, when you look at a mirror, you are reflecting upon your self perception. <br>
            When Anna Ahkmatova enters the mirror, she is stepping into a new self perception, one that is more accepting of her grief. Anna Ahkmatova only holds a “dull sense of treason” whereas in previous stanzas, she explains how she has been turned aside by this harsh age and her myriad of regrets. She still thinks that she is partially betraying her past self perception of regretting things she could have done. However, her vain regret subsides when entering the mirror, and her self perception eases into acceptance. 
            </p>
        <p>Thus, Anna Ahkmatova effectively uses symbolism to differentiate her self perception at the beginning of the poem from her self perception at the end of the poem to show her changing self perception in relation to time.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p>In conclusion, Anna Ahkmatova expresses her regret of not fulfilling her tantalizing dream of immortalizing herself as a poet. However, this regret slowly eases to acceptance throughout the poem. The authorial diction with regards to time illustrates this long, gradual change in self perception undergone by the author. The poem’s free verse form offers a retrospective atmosphere that alludes to the passage of time. Finally, symbolism amplifies the dichotomy between her past self perception and present self perception. 

        </p>
        <p>Whereas in other poems, Anna Ahkmatova writes vividly about war, love, and suffering with regards to other people, in “Northern Elegies: Fifth”, she reminisces cathartically. 
            Anna Akhmatova utilizes the passing of time to convey the gradual shift from her regretful self perception to a more accepting self perception.
