    <div class="paragraph">
        <a href="Ivan D Passage.pdf" target="_blank">PDF of the passage being analyzed below</a>
        <h2 class="paragraph-title">By what techniques has the author built up the atmosphere in the passage? </h2>
        <p>In the passage from “One Day in the life of Ivan Denisovich '', a short, dark Maldovian has apparently gone missing from a russian labor camp, which has spurred the mass of workers into a frenzy. The workers in the passage have been toiling for “11 hours” in the Russian winter, thus they are growing uncontrollably restless. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the author of “One Day in the life of Ivan Denisovich '' gives life to the jerky panic of the fatigued workers in the labor camp to evoke pity from the reader. The author builds up a suspenseful atmosphere through the use of a fast-paced structuring, the employing of curses and drab imagery, as well as diction.</p>
        <p>Fast paced structure forces the reader to scan the page faster. This causes the reader to immerse themself into a suspenseful atmosphere. The structure is fast paced due to the vacillation of events and thoughts, as well as the spontaneous insinuation of rhetorical questions, meant to evoke panic. </p>
        <p>The author starts the passage with the only dialogue in the whole passage, a shout with an exclamation mark at the end: “Man missing in 32! In 32!” After that, Shukhov is described hurriedly listening to what is happening. A few sentences after, two rhetorical questions ensue: “Which one of them did they mean? The one they said was a Romanian spy, a real one?” Because the situation is vague, as the author only expended three sentences to lay out the general cacophony, these questions, which are rhetorical in effect, are meant to evoke the same panic and confusion in the reader as in Ivan Denisovich. The question is meant to be repeated by the reader, so that the reader comprehends the dire vacillation of thought upheld in Shukhov’s mind. Shukhov’s mind racing with frantic rhetorical questions, coupled with the fast-paced structuring in terms of describing the situation at hand rapidly, renders a suspenseful atmosphere. 
        </p>
        <p>Moreover, in the second paragraph, Shukhov goes into a short description on spies in the labor camp, then proceeds to describe the chief of the escort’s depressed countenance. Subsequently, Shukov enters into a series of vitriol thoughts, containing curses such as “sonofabitch”. The vacillation of events and thoughts confuses the reader and shifts the reader quickly from one event to another; thus, it meets the author’s goal of making the reader emulate the same general emotion as the protagonist, Ivan Denisovich: an atmosphere of confusion and suspense. 
        </p>
        <p> Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn also employs drab imagery and cursing to create a suspenseful and confusing atmosphere. Cursing such as “sonofabitch”, “freezing and bitching around”, “tear the goddamn bastard to pieces” and the “fucking bastard” expresses Ivan Denosovich’s panic, and suspenseful emotions in the instant. When Ivan Denisovitch sweared “who did he think he was, this goddamn skunk, the sonofabitch, the fucking bastard!”, Ivan’s panic was manifest to the reader through coarse, inane language without thought put into it. Furthermore, the chief of escort’s panic was shown through imagery as when he looked at the list to see if the moldovian spy was on it, “his face turned black” as in fear. Near the end of the passage, Shukhov thinks that if the moldovian “kept them hanging around here another half hour … and the escorts handed him over to the crowd, they’d tear the goddamn bastard to pieces like wolves.” The suspense has culminated to the point where the whole crowd is mad enough to undergo cannibalistic, inhuman actions. The author successfully manifests the character’s fears and panic through drab and swearing imagery. 
        </p>
        <p>Finally, the author chooses befitting words that build upon the suspenseful and confusing atmosphere. Shukhov describes the spy as “moldavian” and perhaps “romanian”. These words were used to demonstrate the racist, apprehensible stigma associated with the spy. This allows the author to build upon the mood by making Shukhov further describe the spy as a “bastard”, “sonofabitch”, and “skunk” enraged remarks that reflect the suspenseful atmosphere. Shukhov is cursing to release his anger cathartically onto the moldavian spy, first through racist remarks, then through invective curses; Shukhov is normally a stoic character, but at the unwonted usage of these racist remarks and curses, the reader can see a shift in the character’s emotions, which brings about a shift in the general atmosphere, towards one of more suspense. The author also uses diction to impart the suspenseful and confusing effects of the cold weather:
        </p>
        <p> “The cold was getting into them now. Nobody could stand still. They stomped their feet on the ground or edged back and forth”. 
        </p>
        <p>“Nobody could stand still” reflects the suspenseful jerky atmosphere, where no one could stay calm, but instead, they were getting affected by the cold. “Edged back and forth” shows the confusion at the moment, as no one is calm, but on their feet, doing weird habitual movements such as “Stomping their feet”. Moreover, the authorial choice of “the cold getting into them” is symbolic of the suspense and confusion siphoning into the atmosphere. The diction of words such as “still”, “edge”, “getting into them” induce a restless mood concerning the characters; this thereby renders a suspenseful and confusing atmosphere. 
        </p>
        <p>In conclusion, in “One day in the life of Ivan Denisovich”, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn employs imagery and cursing to create a suspenseful atmosphere. He also utilizes a fast paced structure, mainly through vacillation of thought and events, and the insinuation of rhetorical questions to broadcast the panicky and confused emotions of the protagonist onto the reader. Both of these methods render a confusing and suspenseful atmosphere.
