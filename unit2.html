        <h1 class="paragraph-title paragraph">Gender Politics and Contrast Analysis</h1>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Gender politics in Shakespeare is a two-sided view offered by both men and women. In Elizabethan society, woman usually stayed at home, tended the slaves, and were more obedient to their husbands, whereas men are seen performing soldier duties and are considerably more irascible and patronizing. 
                Shakespeare’s best use of gender stigmas is displayed in two dialogues, one from Iago, and the other from Emilia. 
                </p>
            <span class="quote">"Blessed fig’s-end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes. 
                If she had been blessed, she would never have loved the Moor."
                </span>
            <span><strong>(2.1.270-273)</strong></span>
            <p>Iago tells Roderigo that Desdemona (who Roderigo lusts for) drinks the same wine made out of grapes as every other woman. The saying means that Desdemona is a woman, like all other women, and should not be held in a higher regard just because she is prettier. Iago also comments that if Desdemona was “blessed” or more moral than others, she would have not loved the Moor. Iago thinks loving a moor (a racial epithet for black people) is vulgar due to the marriage between a venetian and moor deemed to be repulsive in the Elizabethan era. Thus, Iago besmirches Desdemona’s innocent, non discriminatory character by imparting wrongfully that she would never love the Moor, so that he can paint the next words into Cassio's head vividly. </p>
            <p>Iago subsequently says:</p>
            <span class="quote">“Blessed pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that?”</span>
            <span><strong>(2.1.273-275)</strong></span>
            <p>“His hand” refers to Cassio’s hand. Iago has deceitfully painted the imagery that Desdemona would never love someone of the opposite skin color, so she chose to love the fair-skinned, venetian, Cassio instead (which is a lie). 
                Iago has unscrupulously used sexism to manipulate Roderigo into thinking that Desdemona loves Cassio, for reasons manifest later in the story. 
                </p>
            <span class="quote">“ 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
                They are all but stomachs, and we all but food.
                To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,
                They belch us.”
                </span>
            <span><strong>(3.4.92-95)</strong></span>
            <p>Desdemona, as a tender, innocent person who does not like to disagree or fight, thinks that the reason Othello is angry at her, is because of her own actions. Instead, Othello’s rage was internalized by his own radical suspicions which were influenced by Iago. Emilia, Desdemona’s maid attempts to placate her by implying that all men are voracious jerks and that it is not her fault for losing a handkerchief. “They” refers to men, and “We” refers to women. Emilia propounds that men “eat” women “hungerly” or in modern language, men take advantage of women. “When they are full, they belch us” means that when men get bored and nauseated of their wife, they reject her or “belch” her. </p>
            <p>Emilia besmirches Othello’s debonair character, which is mostly valid, as Othello committed inappropriate actions to his wife. However, Othello and Emilia both do not know that the real ventriloquist pulling the strings is Iago, who has manipulated Othello into directing his unwarranted anger towards Desdemona. </p>
            <p>The two quotes perfectly demonstrate the contrasting perspectives between a woman’s view on men, and a man’s view of a woman. What makes the contrast more effective is that Iago and Emilia are husband and wife, yet they share dichotomous gender political views. Furthermore, the reasons in which the two characters employ sexist perspectives are pellucidly different; Iago used gender politics to manipulate a pawn whereas Emilia ranted about the vices of men to placate a downtrodden mistress. </p>
