            The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice is an african saying; however, 
            it also contains a relatively significant <strong>double consciousness</strong> value that sympathizes with 
            the general black audience. 
            Double consciousness is the notion of a Negro looking through the lens of the 
            american white opressor, and an african-american Negro. The blacker the berry signifies a 
            Negro with blacker skin, whereas the sweeter the juice has a <i>double meaning</i>. 
            It could refer to juice and sweet as in fruition and success (the lens of a Negro), 
            or blood being spilled (white opressor). The last line of the chorus epitomizes the double 
            consciousness effect, as the “bigger I shoot” could mean the goals a 
            Negro is shooting for, or, the Negros a white opressor is shooting (gun violence) which 
            is seen repetitvely in the song → desert eagle pistol, Trayvon Martin.

            Kendrick Lamar points out institutional racism by alluding to American history and how the “chains” of slavery are still eminent in contemporary society. But when you scrutinize Kendrick’s lyrics a bit more carefully, you may find that there is a very unique expression of <strong>double meaning</strong>, to propound that black people, no matter how limited and institutionally deprived they are, manage to gather the wherewithals to achieve their goals. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice how Kendrick Lamar defines chains in terms of slavery in the first few lines, but subsequently raps “big gold chains” noting his success. Kendrick’s ancestors were slaves put in chains, but he is now a rapper wearing gold chains. However, Kendrick uses antithesis in “big gold chains full of rocks” to show what he vehemently cares about. It is not the gold chains that he prioritizes, as they are full of rocks, instead, it is the battle for black rights that he cares most about. That is why the gold chains he has earned using his sheer determination is not worth more than rocks to him.

            In the next block of lyrics, Kendrick repeats the same lyric structure. Kendrick first refers to whip as in white oppressors whipping black slaves, but then raps “big whip parked pon' the block”. Whip in slang means car, and a large car often attests to one's affluence. Thus, Kendrick once again explains how his ancestors were taken advantage of by white oppressors, but now, he can pave his own path, and become successful notwithstanding the color of his skin.
